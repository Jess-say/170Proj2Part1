## Project Description
We are going to implement 2 search algorithms: forward selection and backward eliminiation. 

Forward selection starts with an empty set of features and adds one feature at a time. 

Backward elimination works similarly to Forward selection. Instead, it starts with a full set of features and removed one feature at a time.
